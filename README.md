Attendance Tracker
==================

Automated attendance tracking via NodeJS, OpenCV, and Tessel.

This application was for the final project of the course 67-328: Mobile to Cloud: Building Distributed Applications taught by Professor Mertz at Carnegie Mellon University

The server requires OpenCV 4.3.9 to be installed, and the client uses the Tessel camera module
